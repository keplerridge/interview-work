To run the application just copy the path of the index.html file and paste it into your browser. This has only been tested on Chrome but it is so basic that it should work on any browser. If you open your developer tools you will be able to see that it is console logging the temperature of the tank every 6 seconds. Parts of this are using real equations to calculate the heat transfer and other parts have been assumed. I have assumed that the incoming water is heated 2 degrees as it goes through the solar panel and is then put back into the tank. I have also assumed that this storage tank is copmarable to a water heater and stagnant water will only lose about 1 degree per hour. I have not accounted for someone turning on a faucet and using the stored hot water. This has only been run as a test on a storage tank that holds the water only and will heat the water again once it falls below a certain threshold of heat. I have set that threshold at 115 degrees farenheit. For the sake of time and watching the temperature tic I have initialized the temperature of the water in the tank at 114 degrees farenheit.
